# Tezla
Simple Java algorithm to find the shortest/best path.

Given a text file with a map (formatted like CityA), the program finds the fastest path and the path that leaves the most battery.
The paths are outputted as two new text files.

Detailed map format: rows, columns, initial battery level, map
D is the destination, and C's are charing ports (which increment battery level by 5).
